## Flask Application Design for Video Game Mashup

### HTML Files

**1. index.html:**
   - Main HTML file, the entry point of the application.
   - Contains the layout of the game, including the game area, scoreboards, and control buttons.
   - May include links to external resources like JavaScript libraries, CSS stylesheets, etc.

**2. game.html:**
   - HTML file dedicated to the game itself.
   - Contains the actual game logic, rendering the game area, handling player inputs, and updating the game state.
   - Uses JavaScript or a suitable library to implement the game mechanics.

### Routes

**1. @app.route('/'):**
   - Route for the main game page.
   - Serves the index.html file.

**2. @app.route('/game'):**
   - Route for the actual game functionality.
   - Serves the game.html file.

**3. @app.route('/scoreboard'):**
   - Route to display the scoreboard.
   - Can fetch scores from a database or other data storage method.
   - Serves an HTML page with the scoreboard data.

**4. @app.route('/controls'):**
   - Route to handle player controls.
   - Receives input, processes it, and forwards it to the game engine.
   - May use AJAX or WebSockets for real-time updates.

**5. @app.route('/assets/<filename>'):**
   - Route for serving static assets like JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, images, etc.
   - <filename> is a placeholder for the actual file name.
   - Handles requests for static files and serves them appropriately.

### Additional Notes

- Use Flask's built-in Jinja2 templating engine for dynamic content generation.
- Incorporate suitable Javascript libraries for game implementation and UI enhancements.
- Consider user authentication and authorization if the game supports multiplayer or user-specific data.
- Implement appropriate error handling and logging mechanisms for debugging and troubleshooting.
- Use CSS for styling and improving the user interface of the game.
- Implement responsive design principles for cross-platform compatibility.
